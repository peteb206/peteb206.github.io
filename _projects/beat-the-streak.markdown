From the [Beat the Streak contest FAQ's](https://www.mlb.com/apps/beat-the-streak/faqs):
> **What is Beat the Streak?**<br><br>Beat the Streak is a free-to-play contest where fans predict an MLB player to get a hit. If fans build a streak of 57 correct picks (beating baseball’s famous 56-game hitting streak), they could win $5.6 Million. [...] See Beat the Streak’s [Official Rules](https://www.mlb.com/apps/beat-the-streak/official-rules) here.

## Summary
This is a contest where the odds of winning are extremely low. At the end of the day, even MLB's best hitters are human beings and might go hitless against a lesser pitching opponent.

However, the contest is really fun to compete in. I have been playing for years, and I found myself looking up all kinds of stats on <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i><span class="external-link-label">Baseball Savant</span></a>, <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i><span class="external-link-label">Fangraphs</span></a> and other sites to evaluate the batters and pitchers who would be competing each day. This process was very informative but not very scientific, and it was often hard to know which stats mattered the most in order to make the best decision. This inspired me to start collecting useful data and try to build predictive models to best aggregate these statistics into a single number that offered a player's chance to get a hit on a given day.
