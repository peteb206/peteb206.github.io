My name is Pete Berryman, and I love to play, watch and analyze sports.

I created this site so that I could better organize projects I was already working on and to push myself to seek out insight regarding the sports world and get the information down on "paper".

My interest in sports was piqued when I first played on a baseball team in first grade. As a kid who was allowed limited "screen time", I learned to understand the game of baseball primarily by playing the game and studying the stats and box scores in the Birmingham News while I munched on a bowl of cereal each morning. That first grade baseball team I played on was the Yankees, and I decided that Derek Jeter was my favorite player. My mood for a whole day often hinged on whether the box score from the previous night's Yankees game said Jeter was 0 for 4 or 3 for 4.

Over the years, sports (specifically baseball, football and basketball) have played a huge role in my life, creating many great memories, relationships and opportunities.
