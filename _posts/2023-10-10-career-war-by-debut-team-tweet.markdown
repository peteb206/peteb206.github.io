Players who debuted with the St. Louis Cardinals have accumulated more career fWAR (4,966.6) than any other franchise.

1,053 players can say they debuted with the Cardinals, which also leads the MLB.

The 767 players first called up by the Yankees have averaged a 5.76 career fWAR (most in MLB).

Wondering who that team is that still leads the Diamondbacks and Rockies? That's the Louisville Colonels. They had 150 players debut with them from 1892-1899. Honus Wagner (138.1 career fWAR) debuted with them in 1897.
