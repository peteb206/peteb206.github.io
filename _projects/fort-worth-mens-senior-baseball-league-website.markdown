## Summary
I built a new website for a men's baseball league I play in. The old site was through an overpriced service, and it offered limited customizable functionality. The new site includes...
- League standings
- A user-friendly schedule page
- The league's rules
- Each team's roster
- The location of each field where games are played
- Several necessary forms for prospective/current players to fill out

To allow the league's administrators to easily control the content (e.g. game schedule) of the site, the site pulls data from a Google Sheet that they can edit.
