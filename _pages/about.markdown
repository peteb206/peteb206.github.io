My name is Pete Berryman, and I have loved to play, watch and analyze sports for my whole life.

I created this site to better organize my projects, publicize my work and push myself to seek insight into the sports world and get the information "down on paper".

Thanks for visiting the site, and let me know if you have any sports ideas or questions that you think I should dig into!

My interest in sports was piqued when I first played on a baseball team in first grade. As a kid who was allowed limited "screen time", I learned to understand the game of baseball primarily by playing the game and studying the stats and box scores in the Birmingham News while I munched on a bowl of cereal each morning. That first grade baseball team I played on was the Yankees, and I decided that Derek Jeter was my favorite player. My mood for a whole day often hinged on whether the box score from the previous night's Yankees game said Jeter was 0 for 4 or 3 for 4.

Over the years, sports (specifically baseball, football and basketball) have played a huge role in my life, creating many great memories, relationships and opportunities.
