## Introduction
The 2023-2024 school year marks the fourth season I have worked with the Canadian Baseball Network to help identify Canadians who are playing college baseball at the [NCAA](https://web3.ncaa.org/directory/memberList?type=12&sportCode=MBA) (Div. I, II and III), [NAIA](https://naiastats.prestosports.com/sports/bsb/2023-24/teams), [NJCAA](https://www.njcaa.org/sports/bsb/teams) (Div. I, II and III), [CCCAA](https://www.cccaasports.org/sports/bsb/2023-24/teams), [NWAC](https://nwacsports.com/sports/bsb/2023-24/teams) and [USCAA](https://uscaa.prestosports.com/sports/bsb/2023-24/teams) levels. 

Bob Elliott, the site's Editor in Chief, has known my dad for a long time. He covered my dad's college football team at the University of Ottawa, and my dad connected us due to my interest in working in the baseball industry. Bob told me that he maintained a list of Canadians playing college baseball and that it was a very tedious process for him as he checked each college's roster to see if any players' hometowns were in Canada. He recognized that this process needed to be improved, and he asked me if I knew anything about web scraping. I told him I thought I could help.
