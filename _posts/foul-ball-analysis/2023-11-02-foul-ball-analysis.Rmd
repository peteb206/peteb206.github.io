## Intro
We talk often about player tendencies to achieve certain outcomes... a hitter's spray chart, a hitter's launch angle breakdown, a pitcher's pitch distribution, a pitcher's fly ball to ground ball ratio, etc. However, there is a common event that often gets overlooked in baseball analysis: the foul ball. Every now and then, a stat about foul balls will emerge, such as how  [Joey Votto pulled one foul ball into the seats over the first 2,138 plate appearances of his career](https://www.si.com/more-sports/2012/06/05/joey-vottoreds), but more attention is lent to the balls that are put in play, watched or whiffed at.

Foul balls make up nearly 18% of pitch outcomes and can be interpreted in a number of different ways. With less than two strikes...
* the pitch wasn't really what the batter was looking for, but he swung anyway.
* the batter's swing or timing was slightly off.
With two strikes...
* the batter is just trying to stay alive with two strikes.
* the pitch wasn't located well enough or wasn't deceptive enough to miss the bat entirely.

Fouls can feel like a neutral outcome when they happen on the field, but they are almost always a positive outcome for either the pitcher or the hitter. For example, with less than two strikes, a foul ball is a positive outcome for the pitcher. Certain foul balls, like a towering drive that hooks foul, can indicate that the batter has the upper hand, but it still counts like any other strike, and the pitcher can breath a sigh of relief. When there are two strikes, a foul ball is always going to feel like the batter held strong, and the pitcher is annoyed that he has to throw another pitch. In short, a foul ball is a win for the pitcher with less than 2 strikes, and it is a win for the hitter with 2 strikes. With this in mind, I wanted to split hitter and pitcher foul ball tendencies based on the count.

There is a positive correlation between 0/1-Strike Foul % and 2-Strike Foul % (correlation coefficient of 0.42), but substantial variance exists, too. Take Yordan Alvarez, for example. With 0 or 1 strike, he fouls off only 34.1% of pitches, but that number increases to 46.9% with 2 strikes, which is the highest in all of MLB.

There is a clear trend that batters whose 2-strike swings more often result in fouls tend strike out less often.

```{r}
ggplot(
    pitchers.2023.df %>%
      left_join(
        dbGetQuery(bq, 'SELECT
                          pitcher player_id,

                        FROM
                          `mlb.statcast_pitches`
                        WHERE
                          game_year = 2023 AND game_type = "R" AND
                          events IN("strikeout", "strikeout_double_play")
                        GROUP BY
                          pitcher;'),
        by = "player_id") %>%
      mutate(`K%` = K / TBF),
    aes(x = `2-Strike Foul %`, y = `K%`,
        text = paste(Name, "\n2-Strike Foul %: ",
                     percent(`2-Strike Foul %`, accuracy = 0.1), "\nK%: ",
                     percent(`K%`, accuracy = 0.1), sep = ""))) +

However, the same trend is not apparent on a pitcher-by-pitcher basis.

## Hard hit foul balls?
Since Statcast still tracks the exit velocity of foul balls, I wanted to examine not just the frequency with which players hit foul balls, but also how hard they are hitting them (Avg. EV and Hard Hit %)

                   `Foul Balls: Hard-Hit %` = `Foul Balls Hard-Hit %`),

Obviously, no players are going to have a higher hard-hit rate (95 mph off the bat or higher) on foul balls than fair balls, but some players do waste their solid contact by sending
